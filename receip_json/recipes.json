      "Description": "This recipe gives classic burgers a Spanish-style makeover,thanks to a bevy of flavors synonymous with the country’s cuisine.

A refreshing layer of baby  greens—you  may  receive  baby  kale  or arugula—balances  the  rich  burgers.  On  the side, we’re dressing a duo of roasted broccoli and  potato  with  a  zesty  sauce  made  from piquillo pepper (a type of mild chile) and a bit of sherry vinegar. ",
